# homework02-bootstrap
I found Bootstrap  easy to use. So much easier than doing CSS.

For my first attempt before we did the final and comprehensive Bootstrap lecture , I used Bootstraps "Album" template to create the About Me page. After the lecture I decided to do it coding with rows, columns and cards.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/album/
I have included that html file on my git hub as an example. I create a number of test files before I do the final given I am learning from scratch therefore you will see different html files in the repo.
Its called: portwithbstraptemp.html


I created the index file first then used copy and paste for portfolio and contact pages so the consistent elements for each page were set up immediately.

While in class I thought the navbar had to go before the container and I found that it expended across the whole page and I thought it looked better the same width as everything so i therefore placed container before navbar.

I found the bootstrap website really easy to follow.
I used rows, columns and Bootstrap cards and buttons.

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/


I did try the portfolio page using just rows, columns and "img" (no card) and it worked ok - but cards looked better so went with that.

I wnet to the Linkedin website to download the official logo to incorporate that into a button to go to my Linkedin page. (https://brand.linkedin.com/downloads)
The logo was too big and spilled outside of the button. So I recalled from the pre-work that you can size and image. I went to WK3 and looked resizing up and found the syntax. So I put a style and class for the Linkedin image to resize it to 50%and that fixed it. I think there is possibly a better way to do it?

Please note that I do not have any other social media hence there is no FB, twitter or instagram on my page.

I understood that I needed to push all htmls to git hub and publish to get a URL to then put in the hyperlinks for each of the three html pages for the navbar links to work.

I'm still not sure that I have the pages optimised or used the best options from Bootstrap.....but think I'll learn more as we go so have decied to submit as is.
