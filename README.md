Bootstrap was easy to use.
So much easier than doing CSS.

I created the index file first then used copy and paste so the consistent elements for each page were set up immediatley.

While in class I thought the navbar had to go before <div class=container> I found that it expended across the whole page and I thought it looked better the same width as everything so i placed container before navbar.

I found the bootstrap website really easy to follow.

I used rows, columns and cards.

I did try the portfolio page using just rows, columns and "img" (no card) and it worked ok - but cards looked better so went with that.

I'm still not sure that I have the pages optimised or used the best options from Bootstrap.....but think I'll learn more as we go so have decied to submit as is.
